# Personal Freelance & Portfolio Website

This repository contains the source code for my personal freelance and portfolio website. This uses basic html and css. 

## Project Rationale

This project was undertaken to achieve three main goals simultaneously:
1.  To create a professional, client-facing website that demonstrates my design and development capabilities.
2.  To finalize a new personal portfolio site that I have been procrastinating on.
3.  To fulfill the requirements of a design project for my class.

## Product Information

The "product" being sold on this website is **me*, my skills and experience packaged into tangible freelance services. The site is designed to function like a professional service platform (e.g., Fiverr) where clients can clearly see the services I offer, understand my areas of expertise, and initiate contact for potential projects. All skills and project experiences listed are accurate and reflect my true capabilities.

## Design Choices

### Color Scheme
The visual aesthetic is built around a monochrome pink/red color palette. The colors are used to create a visual hierarchy, with the darkest shade for text to ensure readability and the brightest shades for calls-to-action.

-   **Primary Text & Headings**: `#a4133c` (Dark Red/Magenta)
-   **Accent / Secondary Text**: `#c9184a` (Medium Red/Magenta)
-   **Buttons & Strong Accents**: `#ff4d6d` (Bright Pink/Red)
-   **Borders & Subtle Highlights**: `#ff758f` (Lighter Pink)
-   **Background**: `#fff0f3` (Very Pale Pink)

### Font Families
The 'Stack Sans Notch' font from Google Fonts was chosen. It is used in two weights.

-   **Body Text (`p`, `li`, etc.)**: Light weight (`font-weight: 200`) for paragraphs.
-   **Headings (`h1`, `h2`, etc.)**: Bold weight (`font-weight: 700`) for titles.
