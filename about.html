        <h2>About Us</h2>

            <h3>Why Work With Us?</h3>
            <p>
                Our lead developer, Shridhara Pavel, believes the best developers are also great teachers. In his free time, he runs a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@pavelaugust" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a> where he breaks down complex topics like CUDA programming and OS internals. This passion for teaching reflects in our work: we build solutions that are not only powerful but also well-documented and easy to understand.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our team's experience is broad, spanning from low-level machine learning compilers to full-stack web and game development. This versatility means we can see the bigger picture and tackle challenges from different angles, whether your project needs a robust backend, a fluid user interface, or a complex machine learning model. Led by a full-time full-stack engineer and part-time project lead, our team brings both deep technical skills and the leadership needed to see a project through to success.
            </p>
            <p>
                While we're comfortable across the stack, our real passion is in low-level development. This fascination with what's "under the hood" drives us to write highly efficient, optimized code, which translates into faster, more reliable, and cost-effective applications for our clients.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Meet the Team</h4>
